BibTeX is a way of encoding references for use by the LaTeX mathematical typesetting tool. In this context, a reference might be a journal article, book chapter, or contribution to a conference proceedings volume, for example. BibTeX is based on .bib files, which are plain text files encoding lists of references. Each reference contains standard fields, such as the author, title, volume number, pages etc. Here is an example BibTeX reference: 

@article{Man02 
author = "D.F. Manlove", 
title = "The structure of stable marriage with indifference", 
journal = "Discrete Applied Mathematics", 
volume = "122", 
number = "1-3", 
pages = "167-181", 
year = "2002"} 

The purpose of this project is to provide a web browser-driven tool that can allow multiple users to work on sets of shared BibTeX records that are stored on a central database. It involves extending an existing project which already provides features for adding, editing and deleting BibTeX records. Various additional features could be added depending on the student's interests and time constraints.

This project would probably be best suited to a student who has enjoyed the Interactive Systems 3 and Distributed Information Management 3 courses. No prior knowledge of BibTeX (or LaTeX) is required for this project.
