\section*{BibTeX Entry Management - Export All Entries}

\paragraph*{Outline} \

\begin{tabular}{ | l | l | }
\hline
Description & User exports all BibTeX entries in the database. \\ \hline
Actors & All users (See  Future Amendments) \\ \hline
Pre-conditions & There are entries in the database. \\ \hline
Success Post-conditions & A file is downloaded by the user. \\ \hline
Failure Post-conditions & No file is downloaded by the user. \\ \hline
\end{tabular}


\paragraph*{Main flow} \

\begin{tabular}{ | l | l | } \hline
1 & User notifies the system that they wish to download a BibTeX file of all items in the database. \\ \hline
2 & System displays a file export screen. \\ \hline
3 & System generates the file from all BibTeX entry data. \\ \hline
4 & User downloads the file. \\ \hline
5 & User is redirected to the `home' view. \\ \hline
\end{tabular}


\paragraph*{Alternative Flow} \

No anticipated alternative flow.  Option for export will not be displayed if there are no current entries in the database.

\paragraph*{Future Amendments} \

Initially, the system will only be able to handle .bib files. This will most likely be expanded in a later iteration.
