\section*{Problem Definition}
BibTeX is a way of encoding references for use by the LaTeX mathematical typesetting tool. The purpose of this project is to provide a web browser-driven tool that can allow multiple users to work on sets of shared BibTeX records. \\

The tool should provide management of BibTeX records, including the ability to perform additions, modifications, deletions, searches, import and export functions, through the web-based interface.  Entries should be stored in a central database, allowing multiple users to collaborate on a BibTeX entry collection.  This gives rise to the importance of the system authenticating users and giving varying levels of access to users with different privileges. \\

This project builds on efforts by two previous projects; one desktop based GUI-driven application and another multiple user (web interface-driven) tool.  This project will address some of the shortcomings with respect to functionality and usability. \\
