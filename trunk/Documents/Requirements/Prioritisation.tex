\section*{Use Case Prioritisation}

1 - 3 : Most important to Least important.

1. Add, Edit, Delete, Import Batch, Export All, Basic Search (BibTeX Entry Management Use cases) \\
2. Other BibTeX Entry Management Use Cases, User Management Use Cases \\
3. Advanced Search, Help, Export Current results \& other file formats

Further use cases will be assessed as and when they appear. \\


Risk: Later addition of user and group management might make for difficult domain model modifications later.
Risk Mitigation strategy: Plan the model with future items in mind.
